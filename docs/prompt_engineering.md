# Prompt Engineering Strategy

The prompt engineering strategy used in the simple agent involves crafting specific and clear prompts to guide the agent's behavior and responses. This strategy includes:

1. **Defining Clear Objectives**: Each prompt is designed with a clear objective in mind, ensuring the agent understands the task it needs to accomplish.

2. **Providing Context**: Prompts include relevant context to help the agent understand the situation and provide accurate responses.

3. **Using Specific Instructions**: Instructions within the prompts are specific and detailed, reducing ambiguity and guiding the agent towards the desired outcome.

4. **Iterative Refinement**: Prompts are refined iteratively based on the agent's performance, ensuring continuous improvement in the agent's responses.

By following these strategies, the simple agent can effectively interpret and respond to prompts, ensuring accurate and relevant outputs.
